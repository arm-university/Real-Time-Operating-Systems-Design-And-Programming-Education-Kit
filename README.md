## About
Welcome to our Real-Time Operating Systems Design And Programming Education Kit!

Our flagship offering to universities worldwide is the Arm University Program Education Kit series.

These self-contained educational materials offered exclusively and at no cost to academics and teaching staff worldwide. They’re designed to support your day-to-day teaching on core electronic engineering and computer science subjects. You have the freedom to choose which modules to teach – you can use all the modules in the Education Kit or only those that are most appropriate to your teaching outcomes.

Our Real-Time Operating Systems Design And Programming Education Kit teaches your students how operating systems control individual devices, and how to enable the efficient functioning of device networks, especially in real-time environments. Given the complex tasks facing today’s computing devices, operating systems must be stable, fast and efficient, particularly given the interaction between devices that recent technologies such as the Internet of Things will bring. A full description of the education kit can be found [here](https://www.arm.com/resources/education/education-kits/real-time-operating-systems).


 ## Kit specification:

* A full set of lecture slides, ready for use in a typical 10-12-week undergraduate course (full syllabus below).
* Lab manual with solutions for faculty. Labs use low cost, powerful hardware boards (donated by partners and subject to availability).
* License for royalty-free Keil RTX Real-Time OS bundled with Keil MDK development software.
* **Prerequisites:** Basics of programming

## Course Aim
To produce students who can design and program real-time operating systems on Arm-based platforms and use them to improve their application performance.

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.
 
Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This course has been updated to replace references to non-inclusive language. We recognise that some of you will be accustomed to using the previous terms and may not immediately recognise their replacements. Please refer to the following example:

* When introducing the AMBA AXI Protocols, we will use the term ‘Manager’ instead of ‘Master’ and ‘Subordinate’ instead of ‘Slave’. 

This course may still contain other references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community.
 
Contact us at education@arm.com with questions or comments about this course. You can also report non-inclusive and offensive terminology usage in Arm content at terms@arm.com.
